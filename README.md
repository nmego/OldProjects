# Old Projects

A couple of tiny old projects I made while I was learning Python.

## number2letter.py

This one lets the user enter a number (say 5) and it will output the corresponding letter (e). You can keep building up a word like this. 

- Pass -1 to move to the next word (add a space).
- Pass -2 to reset the sentence entirely.
- Pass -3 to end the program.

## random_tester.py
This one is a random simulator. Basically, it keeps generating random numbers between (0, 1) and taking their averages, and see how their averages converge to 0.5 over time.
